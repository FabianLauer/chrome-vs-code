## Google Chrome for Visual Studio Code.


### **First things first:** This is a preview.

Chrome VS Code is currently an early version of what could become a very handy extension for many Visual Studio Code users. Chrome VS Code has to work around content security policies to escape VS Code's sandbox though, which means that **security concerns are yet to be resolved**. To limit these concerns, the following precautions are taken:

- **No cookies as of yet.** This means you can't log in anywhere.
- **No local storage, session storage, etc.**

This means, **there is no such thing as safe browsing**. Make sure you're fine with the risk before you install and use it. Also, you are *very* likely to encounter bugs â€” please be a dear and report them over at GitHub. Or why not submit a PR or two? ðŸ˜‰

## How Chrome VS Code escapes the sandbox

VS Code has the capability of showing so called *virtual documents* in editor tabs. They are normally used to render previews for HTML, CSS, SVG, Markdown files and so on. Chrome VS Code renders its GUI inside such a virtual document.

Virtual documents live in a sandbox, though. This means that communication with a virtual document via JavaScript is limited by the same origin policy, thus just loading any website, say google.com, inside a virtual document will immediately prevent the JavaScript code 'surrounding' the virtual document from accessing the loaded web page. This is where it becomes tricky: In order for a browser to control web pages (UI and code injection), both the browser and the webpage must be loaded from the same origin.

To do this, Chrome VS Code runs a proxy server in the extension process through which requests are redirected. While not particularly elegant, it allows to circumvent the SOP.
