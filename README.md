## Google Chrome for Visual Studio Code.


### **First things first:** This is a preview.

Chrome VS Code is an early version of (what could become) a very handy extension for many Visual Studio Code users. Chrome VS Code has to work around content security policies to escape VS Code's sandbox, which means that **security concerns are yet to be resolved**. To limit these concerns, the following precautions are taken:

- **No cookies as of yet.** This means you will not be able to log into websites, or use website that heavily rely on cookies.
- **No Local storage, Session storage etc.**

In simpler terms, **there is nothing as safe browsing as of now**. Make sure you're fine with the risk before you install and use it. Also, It is *very* likely for you to encounter bugs â€” please be a dear and report them over at GitHub or you can submit a PR or two, We don't mind it. Seriously.. ðŸ˜‰

## Known Issues

Unfortunately, some issues are probably to stay, until a workarund is figured out. 

- Tab rebuilds after being hidden or dragged [#15437](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/15437)

## How exactly does Chrome VS Code escapes the sandbox?

VS Code has the capability of showing so called *virtual documents* in editor tabs. They are normally used to render previews for HTML, CSS, SVG, Markdown files and so on. Chrome VS Code renders its GUI inside such a virtual document.

Virtual documents live in a sandbox which means that communication with a virtual document (via JavaScript) is limited by the same origin policy, thus just loading any website (say google.com) inside a virtual document will immediately prevent the JavaScript code 'surrounding' the virtual document from accessing the loaded web page. This is where it becomes tricky. 

For a browser to control web pages (UI and code injection) both the browser and the webpage must be loaded from the same origin.
In order to do this, Chrome VS Code runs a proxy server in the extension process through which requests are redirected, which is not particularly elegant, but it allows to circumvent the SOP.
